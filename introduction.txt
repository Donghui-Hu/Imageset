This image database is specifically built for the research of cover source mismatch (CSM) in steganalysis. The images from taken from 21 different types of mobile phones, with each type containing about 1000 images. To ensure the image quality and to reduce the effects of CSM factors other than camera brands, we recruited many college students to take images and collect the images from their mobile phones (with compensation) by complying with the following requirements: 1) the images should be taken in standard camera mode; 2) for images taken by the same phone, the same scene does not exceed ten images; 3) no blurred images; 4) before transmitting to our data set via standard phone data lines, the images are only stored on the mobile storage devices; 5) the images are not subjected to any form of re-processing (after they have been taken as images by their mobile phone camera modules); and 6) the number of images taken by the same mobile phone (with the same phone camera brand) should not be less than 1000.
